        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting this page. My name is Evan Iswahyudi. I am from Shoreline, Washington.
            I graduated from University of Washington in 2017 majoring in GIS (Geographic Information System).
            I have worked in different companies before I came into the web development.
            My work experieces have taught me multitude skills in different areas. Looking back I would not be
            where I am today without having these experiences. Currently, I am attending the University of Washington
            Bootcamp.
            Initially, I was reluctant to go back to school after so many years of working. But, this program has been
            nothing
            but AWESOME. Not only that I get to gain knowledge, but the students interactions, group discussions,
            projects, etc. have
            made it more exciting! I cannot wait to learn more and be able to use it for the stuff I want to create.
        </p>

        <p>Things I like to do: Photography, Sports, Drumming, and Snowboarding. The good thing about my hobbies is that
            I get to be
            active all year long. There is no season where I cannot enjoy esp. with photography. People often ask me
            what
            I like to do for fun. And when I answer photography, that usually cover my base for all year long. There is
            beauty in
            every season.</p>
